          I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate driven by curiosity and a passion for creating technology that makes a real difference. Currently, I work as a Training and Content Specialist at a top software company in Bangladesh, where hands-on experience with multiple projects and AI tools has inspired my research interests in Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility, Health Informatics, and Information Retrieval. My final-year thesis, "Real-time Unwanted Scenes Detection and Blurring," focused on protecting children from inappropriate content, combining YOLOv6 for precise detection with OpenCV for efficient blurring—an experience that reinforced my desire to develop research that impacts people’s everyday lives.

          Outside the office, I am a cat lover, a passionate cook and baker, and a painter in my leisure time—hobbies that spark my creativity and curiosity. I strive to bring the same energy, curiosity, and attention to detail from my personal pursuits into my research, seeking to design solutions that are both technically innovative and human-centered.
